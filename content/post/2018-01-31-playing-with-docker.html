<h1>A Little Bit of Background</h1>
<p>This semester, I’m taking a course on Computer Vision as part of my Master’s degree at Georgia Tech. The course depends heavily on a specific version of the Python <a href="https://opencv.org/">OpenCV library</a>. As a conda guy, I tend to run multiple versions of Python and multiple versions of libraries on a single machine, so I first tried creating a new conda environment and running that.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it turns out that, while OpenCV is available on <a href="https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/opencv">Conda Forge</a>, only the Ubuntu version of the package hosted there works properly with FFmpeg. This meant that I was unable to read and write video on Windows. Rather than trying to get the conda version to work on Windows (I’m often on Windows machines) I decided to learn something while I fixed the problem and see if I could make a platform-agnostic version of the environment using Docker.</p>

<h1>Learning the Docker Basics</h1>
<p>While I have a vague idea of what Docker is and how it’s useful, I’m pretty much a novice when it comes to actually using it.</p>
