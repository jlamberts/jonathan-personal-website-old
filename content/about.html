title: About Me
---



<p>I’m a computer scientist and data scientist who learns best by poking things and seeing what happens. I studied Industrial Engineering at Georgia Tech as an undergrad and I’m in the process of getting my MS in Computer Science at Georgia Tech’s <a href="http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/">OMSCS program</a>. During the day I work as a Data Science consultant at Axis Group in Atlanta, Ga. If you’re interested in my resume, you can find it <a href="/pdf/resume.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>In my free time, I <del>fight crime in a rubber suit</del> exercise, cook, read, play video games, and play board games (and apparently write blog posts).</p>

<h1>Some Things I’ve Done</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>I gave a lightning talk on Jupyter Notebook tips and tricks at the Atlanta Pydata Meetup. You can find the talk <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1upVXqeTN8E2wm6mo4BR7YojgG6Js3DqLZZmtn32NDE8/edit#slide=id.p">here.</a></p></li>
<li><p>I gave a talk at the Atlanta Jupyter Users Group on the motivations of Bitcoin and some of the challenges that arise when financially analyzing cryptocurrencies compared to traditional financial assets. The notebook used in the talk is <a href="https://gist.github.com/jlamberts/2abff8be4132ca71b4b2ad0cd4666e57">here</a>, although I’ll probably try to convert it into a full-form blog post.</p></li>
