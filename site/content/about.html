title: About Me
---



<p>I’m a computer scientist and data scientist who learns best by poking things and seeing what happens. I studied Industrial Engineering at Georgia Tech as an undergrad and I’m in the process of getting my MS in Computer Science at Georgia Tech’s <a href="http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/">OMSCS program</a>. During the day I work as a Data Science consultant at Axis Group. By night I <del>fight crime in a rubber suit</del> enjoy cooking, exercising, reading, video games, and board games. If you’re interested in my resume, you can find it <a href="/pdf/resume.pdf">here</a>.</p>
