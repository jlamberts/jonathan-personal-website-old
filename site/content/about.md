title: About Me
author: Jonathan Lamberts

I'm a computer and data scientist who learns best by poking things and seeing what happens.  I studied Industrial Engineering at Georgia Tech
as an under grad and I'm in the process of getting my MS in GT's Online Master's of Computer Scientist part-time.  During the day I work as a Data Science consultant at 
Axis Group.  By night I ~~fight crime in a rubber suit~~ enjoy cooking, exercising, reading, video games, and aforementioned poking of things.
