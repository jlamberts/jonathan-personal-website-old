# JONATHAN LAMBERTS

## _Still working on actually populating this site with stuff_



```python
while True:
	print('hello world')
```

stay tuned while I work on filling out things about myself that you probably don't care about and maybe also eventually a blog post probably

 [leaving this here so I remember how to add latex](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin/blob/master/exampleSite/layouts/partials/foot_custom.html), it can easily support LaTeX math expressions, e.g.,

`$${\sqrt {n}}\left(\left({\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}X_{i}\right)-\mu \right)\ {\xrightarrow {d}}\ N\left(0,\sigma ^{2}\right)$$`

All pages not under the root directory of the website are listed below. You can also visit the list page of a single section, e.g., [posts](/post/), or [notes](/note/). See the [About](/about/) page for the usage of this theme.
